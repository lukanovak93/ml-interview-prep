\subsection{Q: Merge k (k = 2) arrays and sort them}
The best way to do this would be to sort two arrays and then merge them. 
Complexity of that algorithm is: \[O(nlogn + mlogm + (n + m))\]
The Python code for this solution is:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
# Function to merge array in sorted order
def sortedMerge(a, b, res, n, m):
    # Sorting a[] and b[]
    a.sort()
    b.sort()
     
    # Merge two sorted arrays into res[]
    i, j, k = 0, 0, 0
    while (i < n and j < m):
        if (a[i] <= b[j]):
            res[k] = a[i]
            i += 1
            k += 1
        else:
            res[k] = b[j]
            j += 1
            k += 1
             
    while (i < n):  # Merging remaining
                    # elements of a[] (if any)
        res[k] = a[i]
        i += 1
        k += 1
         
    while (j < m):  # Merging remaining
                    # elements of b[] (if any)
        res[k] = b[j]
        j += 1
        k += 1
\end{lstlisting}
